if u added new dependecies, run the command:

mvn clean package

after that "copy" them:

mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

this will remove the error of "cant find dependencies in jar" and will run.
but everytime u need to compile ur code into a jar, use:

mvn package

so it wont delete the "copy"

now run the project like this:
java -cp target/Assignment1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:target/dependency/* Assignment1.LocalApplication input-sample-1.txt outputFileName.txt 500 terminate
